			<h3>Fun Problems (Perhaps Pertaining to Course Content)</h3>
			<p>Note: many of these problems are adapted from "Problems of the Day" given at the beginning of lectures by <a class="texta" href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sinclair/">Prof. Sinclair</a> and <a class="texta" href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yss/">Prof. Song</a> in the Fall 2019 iteration of CS 70. I enjoyed solving these problems, and hope that current students of CS 70 will find them interesting as well.</p>
			<h4>I. Two Logic Puzzles:</h4>
			<p>1. Bob is accused of murder. Bob's attorney never lies. The Judge states:"If Bob committed this crime, he didn't act alone." The Attorney responds:"That's not true!" <span class="emph">Question:</span> Did the attorney help Bob?</p>
			<p>2. Is the statement "A watched child never falls asleep unless they are watched" True, False, or Undetermined?</p>
